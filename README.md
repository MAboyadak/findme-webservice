# findme-webservice

This is my web service of Findme project

Findme is a face recognition-based system , it's my graduation project, which helps people to find their lost children
Allowing them to upload their lost child's data such as name,city,details and ,most important, Image for the child

this web service handles all methods needed in android which i have created from scratch using php,
and in android side i use volley for sending and fetching data.
